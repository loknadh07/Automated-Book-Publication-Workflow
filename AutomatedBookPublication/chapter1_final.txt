Threat from Palm Tree
CHAPTER I
THE CANOE BUILDER

Dick, the newly appointed chief of Karolin, stood on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the mighty breakers of the outer sea crashed and sprayed, while before him lay the vast, serene expanse of Karolin's lagoon, a forty-mile stretch of water that could be a raging sea in high winds or a tranquil azure lake in gentle breezes. Just yesterday, he had arrived, and now it was all his—the bustling tribe along the beach, fishing, playing, working in their gardens; the canoes resting on the sand; the empty houses that once held war canoes.

A flicker of concern crossed his face as he shifted his gaze from the lagoon to the canoe houses. Turning his back to the calm inner waters, he faced the thundering breakers of the outer sea, looking north. Far beyond the horizon lay Palm Tree, an island of breathtaking beauty, yet it was a place swarming with danger.

Nearby, Little Tari, son of the net-maker Le Taioi, looked up at Dick. Tari, though young, understood the vulnerability of his people. The men of Karolin had been lost to war, leaving the women, boys, and children defenseless and without a leader. Then, just yesterday, from the northern sea, a strange boat appeared, carrying Katafa, a girl who had been swept out to sea years ago while fishing, and this new, powerful figure the women believed was sent by the gods to be their chief.

"Taori," Tari asked with the innocent directness of a child, "who are you?"

Dick couldn't fully answer. The name "Dick Lestrange" and the language of his childhood were lost to him. Even Kearney, the old sailor who had raised him on Palm Tree, was a dim memory, faded into the luminous haze of his past. The past, for those long shipwrecked and alone, becomes a blur. For Dick, his history truly began with Katafa's arrival on Marua (Palm Tree). Everything before that was consumed by the tropical light, the storms, and the mists. Only the small, playful ships Kearney had crafted for him remained as tangible links to that forgotten time.

Looking down at the questioning child, Dick simply replied, "I am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?"

"I do not know," the child said, his attention already diverted by the cries of children hauling in a net. "I ask as I breathe, but no big folk—madyana—will ever answer the questions of Tari—Ai, the fish!" Tari trotted off, his curious mind having moved on.

Dick's gaze returned to the north. Tari's question had stirred his memories. He saw the schooner docking at Palm Tree, only to be burned by the Melanesians. He relived his escape with Katafa in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to sail. He saw their landing yesterday on Karolin's beach, the women and children flocking around him, seeing him as a god-sent leader.

Yet, as he looked north, the memory of the men from whom they had escaped stained the beauty of the sea and sky. There was no immediate threat; the men on Palm Tree had no canoes. But they would build them, surely. And just as he had seen it, they would see the distant, blazing mirror of Karolin lagoon in the sky. They would come. It might be a long time, but they would come.

Dick, a "blook" or "kanaka," a savage in many ways, possessed the foresight and imagination of a white man. This was why he had sent a canoe that morning to the southern beach to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—three old, war-weary but expert canoe-builders. It was why, observing the assembled tribe, his eyes brightened at the sight of nearly a hundred youths approaching warrior age. But above all, fueling his thoughts and inspiring his daring, was his deep passion for Katafa, his other self, dearer to him than his own life, and now, however vaguely, threatened.

War canoes! Did he plan to fight invaders in the lagoon or as they approached the shore? Or did he intend to strike first, destroying the danger at its source? Who could say?

A hand on his shoulder made him turn. It was Katafa, a lock of her dark hair, freed from its elastic vine, blowing back like an eagle's feather. Her luminous dark eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the northern horizon, where he had been gazing.

"Look!" Katafa exclaimed.

Under certain weather conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the sea line, would become visible from Karolin through a mirage. They had seen it last evening, and now it was reappearing, a mysterious stain low in the southern sky, a dull spot in the sea's dazzle that gradually deepened and hardened until the island emerged, beautiful as a dream, diaphanous yet vivid, as if sketched by an unseen hand.

With her hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, untutored in the ways of mirage, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had escaped, now rising strangely from beyond the horizon as if to confront them. They saw again the horde of savages on the beach, monstrous figures from a nightmare. They felt again the wind filling the sail as their dinghy raced for safety and the open sea, and heard again the yells of the Melanesians, mad with rum stolen from the schooner they had burned. Before them lay the scene of the tragedy, a beautiful image that hid the demons still inhabiting it.

As Dick gazed at this captivating yet menacing vision, his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him—that was nothing. But they had threatened Katafa—that was everything—and they still did.

Someday, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree echoed his instinct. They would build canoes, and seeing the lagoon's mirror-light in the sky, they would come. Those men had no women, and here were women. His instinct whispered that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, these men would be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for an island to raid for its women, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.

Ah, if only he had known, danger lurked not only to the north but wherever greed, desire, or hatred roamed on that azure sea—not only among savages but among the "wolves of civilization" as well. For Dick, there was no world beyond the water that encircled the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history beyond his and Katafa's short lives. Yet, even in that brief life, he had learned to dread men and had grasped the fundamental truth of all history: man's instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.

Then, gradually, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing suddenly like a blown-out light. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach. It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe-builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
